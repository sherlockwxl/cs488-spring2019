Compilation: (base directory: A3)
Steps:
    1. $ premake4 gmake
    2. $ make
    3. $ ./A4 Assets/sample.lua (1000 * 1000 image may take longer to render)

Machine: gl36
===============================================================================
Manual:

All required features implemented. All required images including nonhier-bb and macho-cows-bb
are also submitted.

Extra Feature:
super sampling.
In the A4.cpp file, there is a variable named supersamplingAmt. It control the 
size of sample grid. Eg: if the variable is set to 3, color will be sampled on a 
3 * 3 grid averge on the nine color values returned.

Bounding Volume Code:
implemented in mesh.cpp. I use a sphere for bounding volume.
Uncomment the option in mesh.hpp will use the bounding volume for image render
PLease note I disabled the bounding volume on plane object for easy and clear output.

Novel Scene:
Thousands of years from now, the group of cows are the only species survived from the nuclear war. 
And they have developed the spaceship and looking forward to moving to another planet with no war 
and more grass.  The day they finally find the liveable planet, a floating Mickey shows up and 
deployed many red fences and try to stop them from boarding the spaceship.  
Another war is on the horizon and let's see who gonna win the battle.
