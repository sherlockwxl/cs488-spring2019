Compilation: (base directory: A3)
Steps:
    1. $ premake4 gmake
    2. $ make
    3. $ ./A3 Assets/puppet.lua

Machine: gl13
===============================================================================
Manual:

All required features implemented.

Data structure change: 
1. add a parent member in the SceneNode for picking implementation.
2. update the translate function for correctly displaying the model

Undo/Redo structure:
I used two stacks for store undo/redo operations. Each time mouse button is released, all current joint info will be saved into a
vector of GLfloat( the head angle will be pushed into the vector at the end). Then the vector will be pushed into undo stack.
when user perform undo, the program will check if undo stack contains more than one operation( one base operation which is the default value is always in undo stack)
, if not a warning popup will be displayed. Then, the program will pop a joint info vector from the top and reverse the change and push the vector into  the redo stack.
For redo, it is a similar process.

trackball:
I reused the provided code with minor change.


puppet model: It is a baymax!

There are 16 joints(DOFs) in total(including the tail one at the back, you may need to rotate the baymax in order to see it).
