Manual:

All objectives implemented.

Objectives:
_ _ _ 1: Modelling the scene: A scene that represents the fighting room should be rendered. 

 

_ _ _ 2: UI: User should be able to start, pause, restart the game and able to see the life value bar for each character. 

 

_ _ _ 3: Animation: Keyframe animation is implemented using linear interpolation and the characters’ movement should be smooth and natural. 

 

_ _ _ 4: Dynamic Collision detection: A character should be able to hit the other one with the attack. 

 

_ _ _ 5: Sound: background sound added and hit sound correctly synchronized with movement. 

 

_ _ _ 6: Physics engine: The characters are subject to gravitational force (parameter: g) and the static fraction (parameters: coefficient of friction(u) and character’s mass (M)) should be implemented. 

 

_ _ _ 7: Texture mapping: Characters and background should have texture being displayed. 

 

_ _ _ 8: Particle system: Particle effect should be visible when a character is hit successfully. 

 

_ _ _ 9: Static Collision detection: Two characters will be able to stand on the stationary fight platform without falling through. 

 

_ _ _ 10: Shadow: Shadow will be implemented using shadow map and the shadow should be at the correct location (under the character’s feet).
